Game Rules

*The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

*Players take turns placing their marker (X or O) on an empty cell.

*The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

*If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Error Handling

1.The program validates player inputs to ensure they enter valid row and column numbers within the range of the board (0 to 2).

2.It also checks if a cell is already occupied before allowing a player to make a move.
